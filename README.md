# ducky-cli

---

A command line tool for the USB Rubber Ducky

## How it should look

I want the input "ducky" to be global as when downloading metasploit (msfconsole)

~$ ducky

(ducky) path /mnt/usb (can also do this globaly with a yaml file maybe?)
(ducky) file /home/user/Downloads/file.txt
(ducky) run

---

## Features

- Set path for USB
- Set path for the text file
- Flash USB with .bin file
- List current connected USB, so the user does not need to provide/set new path for the usb



Will be used for final project for CS50

## Update log

Will work with installer script

- Only on Linux yet!!!
