# duckyshell
#### Video Demo:  coming soon

A command line tool for flashing the USB Rubber Ducky on the go written in Python with cmd!

## [duckyshell.py](duckyshell.py)

### General

We start of with declaring the config file path for the USB at the start
```python
CONFIG_FILE_PATH = "/usr/bin/duckyshell/config.yaml"
``` 

And at the end I just have the function for running the application
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    shell = DuckyShell()
    shell.cmdloop()
```

### Duckyshell class

This is the class for the whole CLI program. 

When it runs it starts of with clearing the screen (as msfconsole does), prints out the intro, setting the prompt and declaring the USB and file path variables as `None`.
```python
# Clears the screen
 os.system(f"clear")
    
# Prints out the intro
intro = "\nHak5 USB Rubber Ducky CLI\n\nType 'help' to list available commands or 'help <command>' to get help for a specific command.\n"    
# Prompt for the CLI
prompt = "ducky_sh3ll > "
    
# Setting the usb path to None for now
usb_path = None
file_path = None
```
And we declare the help messages for each command
```python
# Help messages for each command
help_messages = {
        'usb': 'Set the USB path for connected USB devices.',
        'file': 'Set the file to the designated inject.bin you want.',
        'list': 'List the connected USB devices.',
        'run': 'Copy the inject.bin to the USB Rubber Ducky.',
        'quit': 'Exit the DuckyShell.',
        'exit': 'Exit the DuckyShell.',
}
```
### Load USB path

I wrote this so you can "set and forget" the path of the USB so you don't need to set it each time you run the program. It reads the config file and sets the `usb_path` to the path inside of the config.
```python
def load_usb_path(self):
        # Load the USB path from the config file
        if os.path.exists(CONFIG_FILE_PATH):
            with open(CONFIG_FILE_PATH, 'r') as config_file:
                config = yaml.safe_load(config_file)
                self.usb_path = config.get('usb_path')
```
Here is the function for saving the usb path to the config file.
```python
def save_usb_path(self):
        # Save the USB path to the config file
        config = {'usb_path': self.usb_path}
        with open(CONFIG_FILE_PATH, 'w') as config_file:
            yaml.safe_dump(config, config_file)
```
### Autocomplete tab feature on USB and files command

This is done by getting the current directory of where the user is and filtering the list on what the user is typing and returning the different possibilities. 

I wanted this feature since I use it so much in the terminal, so I implemented it in this project. 
```python
def complete_file(self, text, line, begidx, endidx):
        # Get a list of files and directories in the current directory
        current_dir = os.getcwd()
        files_and_dirs = os.listdir(current_dir)

        # Filter the list based on the current text being entered
        options = [entry for entry in files_and_dirs if entry.startswith(text)]

        return options

def complete_usb(self, text, line, begidx, endidx):
        # Get a list of files and directories in the current directory
        current_dir = os.getcwd()
        files_and_dirs = os.listdir(current_dir)

        # Filter the list based on the current text being entered
        options = [entry for entry in files_and_dirs if entry.startswith(text)]

        # Returning results
        return options
```
### Return connected USB devices

This is done by searching the `dev/sd` folder in Linux with regex to only return the devices that are present. 
```python
def get_connected_usb_devices(self):
        devices = glob.glob('/dev/sd*[!0-9]')
        return [os.path.basename(device) for device in devices]
```
